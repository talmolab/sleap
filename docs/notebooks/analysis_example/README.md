Files for the [Analysis examples notebook](https://github.com/murthylab/sleap/blob/main/docs/notebooks/Analysis_examples.ipynb). The predictions were trained on the [Drosophila melanogaster courtship sample dataset](https://github.com/murthylab/sleap-datasets).

The analysis notebook just uses the `predictions.analysis.h5` HDF5 file. If you want to take a look at the predictions in the SLEAP GUI, you can download the other files and open `predictions.slp` using `sleap-label`.

Note that the video here is distinct from the video in the training dataset.
