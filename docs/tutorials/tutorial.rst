The tutorial will walk you through the entire SLEAP workflow as described in the :ref:`High-level Overview`. You can read through this tutorial and try running SLEAP on one of our `sample datasets <https://github.com/murthylab/sleap-datasets>`_. Then you will be ready to start using SLEAP on your own data.
