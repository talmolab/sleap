## Contributing

Github has made it easy to separate issues from discussions. Generally speaking, if something warrants a pull request (e.g. bug fixes, TODOs) it should be submitted as an issue. Conversely, general questions about usage and improvement ideas should go into discussions. These both act as staging areas before adding the items to the SLEAP Roadmap. Once added to the Roadmap, items can be given priority, status, assignee(s), etc. 

### Issues
