"""
Read/write for multiple dataset formats.

File adaptors provide a common API for code that reads and/or writes data files.
Usually these are for reading or writing SLEAP datasets or something with
roughly equivalent data (e.g., a COCO keypoint dataset), although the code
can in principle be used for reading/writing different types of data.

For reading or writing SLEAP datasets, use `main.read()` or `main.write()`,
optionally specifying the `as_format` parameter (e.g., if you want to write a
specific, non-default format). `sleap.io.convert` is a nice usage example.

To add support for a new file format:

1. Create an adaptor class which implements all virtual functions in the
   `Adaptor` class. Take a look at `GenericJsonAdaptor` for a simple example
   or `SleapAnalysisAdaptor` for an adaptor which supports reading and writing
   datasets (this would be a good adaptor to use as a template for your own).

2. If it's for reading and/or writing `Labels` datasets (the typical case),
   add it to `all_labels_adaptors` dictionary in `main.py`.

If your file format has a file extension that's distinct from other
supported file formats, then read/write code will automatically detect the
correct format. For example, if your adaptor supports save and its default file
ext is `.foo`, then calling `Labels.save_file(labels, "filename.foo")` will use
your file adaptor.

If your file format does not have a distinct file extension, then additional
work is required. For an example, take a look at the `ExportAnalysisFile` and
`ImportAnalysisFile` command classes (in `sleap.gui.commands`). For the analysis
HDF5 we need custom code since these files have a `.h5` extension, and this is
also a non-default file extension for the `LabelsV1Adaptor` adaptor.
